A short and snappy collection of Jupyter Notebooks to turn Strava activity data in geo-spatial data you can interrogate, and blend it with OpenStreetMap data for recommendations and plotting.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Strava Export**: OAuth flow and API export /activities
- **GeoPandas**: Converting Strava activity data to geo-spatial data that can be interrogated
- **osmx**: OpenStreetMap integration for blending other data with the Strava data
- **Plotting**: Leaflet mapping and other plotting features, seen above and deployed on the repo
- **Deployment**: Deployment of the maps to Github Pages

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Conda (miniconda)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

> NB. Assuming you cloned the repo already, right?

#### 1. Create .env file 

```
STRAVA_C_ID=
STRAVA_C_SECRET=
STRAVA_REDIRECT=http://localhost:8080
STRAVA_C_AUTH_CODE=
STRAVA_C_ACCESS_CODE=

```

Open the `./strava_data.ipynb` next for more instruction. *Some may require that you start running the Jupyter Notebook

#### 2. Create conda env from environment.yml

```
conda env create --name strava_data_analysis --file=environment.yml
```

## üöÄ Usage

Start Conda

```
sh ./scripts/conda_init.sh
```

Start Jupyter Notebooks

```
jupyter notebook
```

Open `strava_data.ipynb` first and work through step until you downloaded `activities.geojson`

---

Follow notebook instructions, from there

`./pyrosm.ipynb` is WIP
